# True Fullscreen
A chrome extension to enable True Fullscreen in the Arduino Create online IDE

The IDE has a fullscreen feature but it only closes the sidemenu without hiding the top or bottom sections. This extension simply removes the HTML and style of all the sections,leaving only the editor.

## How to use
Add it to chrome just like [this](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) getting started tutorial says.

## Knwon bugs
1. The fullscreen button of the IDE is still there.
1. The Donate and Notifications are still there (Workaround: click the fullscreen button of the IDE).
1. Part of the bottom section is left behind (Workaround: click the fullscreen button of the IDE).
